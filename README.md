# Restaurant_Orders_Analysis
Introduction:

In the Restaurant Order Analysis project, we delve into a dataset comprising over 20,000 rows of restaurant order data. The primary objective is to identify the top-selling items on the menu and categorize them based on their respective categories. Leveraging MySQL's querying capabilities, we aim to extract actionable insights that can optimize menu offerings and drive profitability for the restaurant.
